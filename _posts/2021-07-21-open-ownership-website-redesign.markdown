Open Ownership wants to relaunch its website - https://www.openownership.org. We want to ensure that all the information and resources we produce are easily discoverable, accessible and navigable to users worldwide. 

We are looking for a thoughtful and user-focussed contractor or agency to support our site’s redevelopment. The final result should, above all else, ensure that the work we do is highly accessible and easy to navigate. For us that means ensuring that all users, and particularly those from parts of the world where internet connectivity is slower or more expensive, can access the information we produce easily. Like many organisations, our work has often ended up a little locked away in PDFs as research reports and the like - this makes it hard to access and share, and in particular, hard to translate using browser-based translation tools. Solving this challenge is really important for us.

Open Ownership is always an extremely busy organisation and this year is no different. We realise that building the new online presence for the organisation isn’t something that we can just outsource and forget about, but we want to be led by whoever we appoint. So we really want to hear from contractors or agencies who can bring well-structured thinking to how we create simple workflows through the site. This will allow our users to  quickly and easily get to the research, advice and guidance we work hard to produce. We want to carry out this project between September 2021 and the end of March 2022, and the tender budget should not exceed £45,000.

We know that early engagement with potential suppliers really helps make a contract work, so please get in touch with us to talk more about this opportunity if you would like to. We’ll update this page with any questions asked, and the answers we give. The deadline for the submission of tenders is midnight BST on Sunday 15 August 2021.
