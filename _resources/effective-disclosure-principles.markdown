The Open Ownership Principles for effective beneficial ownership disclosure are designed to make published data more easy to use, accurate, and interoperable. These have been reached through Open Ownershipâ€™s work developing the Beneficial Ownership Data Standard and supporting almost 40 countries to advance beneficial ownership
transparency.

They are available in English, Spanish and Indonesian.
