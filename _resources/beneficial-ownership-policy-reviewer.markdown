There are a number of aspects that need to be considered when designing a legal framework for beneficial ownership transparency. The Policy Reviewer works through these aspects, and guides implementers to identify specific decision points around what data is to be collected and what is to be published. The Policy Reviewer does not prescribe a particular policy approach, but is designed to help implementers to explore the relevant areas and identify legal changes required for beneficial ownership transparency.
