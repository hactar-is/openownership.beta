Opening Extractives aims to transform the availability and use of beneficial ownership information for effective governance in the extractive sector.

Opening Extractives will support approximately 13 countries to implement reforms to disclose the ownership of extractive companies. Through the programme, governments, civil society and companies will improve natural resource governance.
