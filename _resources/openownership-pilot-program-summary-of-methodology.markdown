The Open Ownership Pilot Program supports national governments to establish open beneficial ownership registers that meets policy goals â€” from improving the business environment to tackling corruption and money laundering. It distinguishes itself from similar programs in that support is provided in-kind, and across the the range of policy and technical issues that are involved in publishing effective, high-quality data.
