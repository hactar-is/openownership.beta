Anonymously-owned companies stand in the way of better, fairer markets and a more just society. Our mission is to drive greater corporate transparency across the world by making it easy to publish and access high-quality, linked data about who owns companies. 3

Our Mission Statement sets out our vision, as well as our current strategic priorities and the key goals we want to achieve by 2020.
