This spreadsheet template allows beneficial ownership information to be represented as [Beneficial Ownership Data Standard (BODS) 0.2 data](http://standard.openownership.org/en/0.2.0/primer/whatisthebods.html). Once completed, the spreadsheet can be submitted to Open Ownershipâ€™s Data Review Tool for validation and conversion to BODS JSON.
