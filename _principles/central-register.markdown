Having a centralised BO register means that people and authorities can access information on the BO of companies through one central location in a standardised format. This is a prerequisite for effective use of BO data by all user groups, as it removes some of the practical and cost barriers to accessing and analysing BO information.

Maintaining a central BO register is one of three complementary approaches identified as best practice by the global Financial Action Task Force (FATF).
