BOVS:
  Node: A vertex in a BOVS diagram. Nodes function like nouns, representing Parties.
  Arrow: An edge in a BOVS diagram. Arrows function like verbs, connecting Nodes to show relationships.
  Chain: A series of Nodes continuously connected by Arrows is called a Chain. The "start" of the Chain is the first Node and the "end" is the last, based on the direction of the Arrows.
  Party: General term for any kind of thing (e.g. Person, Company) that can be involved in a beneficial ownership situation.
  Assets: Assets are things that can be owned or controlled, but which themselves cannot own or control anything. For instance, someone might own an expensive property. The property is an Asset.
  InterestedParty: Any Party that has ownership or control of another Party. The Interested Party at the start of a Chain is the Beneficial Owner.
  BeneficialOwner: Beneficial Owners are a type of Party that cannot be owned or controlled, and so always begin a Chain, e.g. a Person.
  OwnedEntities: Entities are always owned or controlled by an Interested Party, and can appear at any point in a Chain except the start.
  Person: A single private individual.
  State: A country, state, or governing body with recognised sovereignty; or a department, ministry or fully controlled instrument of such a governing body.
  Listed: A publicly traded company listed on a recognised stock exchange.
  Entity: Any legal construction that a Party could have an interest in, such as a Company, Trust, Partnership, Contract, etc.
  Organisation: Any incorporated entity such as a limited company, public company or charity.
  Trust: A legal arrangement under which a person or entity (the trustee) owns and manages something for the benefit of other persons or entities (the beneficiaries).
  Arrangement: Any agreement between Parties through which they own or control other entities.
  Distance: The Distance between two Nodes is the length of the shortest Chain that connects them. The length of a Chain is the number of Arrows that are present in it. Two parties are 'distant' if the Chain connecting them has a length greater than 1.
  Direct: A Party has a Direct interest in another if the Distance between them is 1. Otherwise the interest is Indirect.
