Together with the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), OO has recently launched Opening Extractives, an ambitious global programme aiming to transform the availability and use of beneficial ownership information for effective governance in the extractive sector (mining, oil, and gas).

The government of Argentina, through its Undersecretary of Mining Development (Ministry of Productive Development), has formally agreed to participate in the programme. OO, working with international and local partners, will provide technical and policy support aimed at improving the implementation of beneficial ownership transparency (BOT) in Argentina’s  procedures and systems, as well as encouraging its use to trigger local changes.

To support the initial work in Argentina, we are seeking a short-term contractor, either an organisation or independent consultant, to conduct desk research, interviews, and legal framework analysis that will help identify concrete opportunities for OO and the EITI to provide technical assistance that furthers BOT in Argentina.
