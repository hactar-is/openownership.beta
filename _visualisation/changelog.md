A record of changes or additions to BOVS is shown below.


## Version 0.2

### [Non-Interest Arrows](/visualisation/core/relationships-arrows)

Arrows between Nodes can be used to display a relationship between those Parties, without implying an interest. For instance, one Party may be the mother of another Party.

### [Assets](/visualisation/core/parties-nodes)

A new type of Node, an Asset, can be added at the end of an interest chain. Assets are things that can be owned or controlled, but which themselves cannot own or control anything. For instance, someone might own an expensive property.

### [Trusts and Arrangements](/visualisation/core/vocabulary)

Icons have been provided to illustrate Entities that are Trusts or Arrangements.


## Version 0.1

* The first public release of the Beneficial Ownership Visualisation System (BOVS).
