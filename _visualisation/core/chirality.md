BOVS Diagrams are [chiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirality){:target="_blank"}, that is, they can’t be mirrored or flipped – there is a correct way around.

[Optional Features](/visualisation/optional) such as [Annotation](/visualisation/optional/annotation) and [Charts](/visualisation/optional/charts) allow BOVS Diagrams to include specific information about the [relationships](/visualisation/core/relationships-arrows) between Parties, such as specifying the nature and strength of interest.

If ownership or control information is shown, it must consistently appear on the correct side of the Arrows/Nodes it relates to (see below).


## Vertical Diagrams

![Vertical BOVS Diagram demonstrating Chirality](/visualisation/diagrams/bovs-core-chirality-vertical.png){: style="width: 62.5%" }

In [vertical diagrams](/visualisation/core/directionality), irrespective of writing direction:

* Control information appears on the right side of the Arrows/Nodes.
* Ownership information appears on the left side of the Arrows/Nodes.

You can remember this with the mnemonic: "*control has the rights, ownership has what's left*".


## Horizontal Diagrams

![Horizontal BOVS Diagram demonstrating Chirality](/visualisation/diagrams/bovs-core-chirality-horizontal.png){: style="width: 62.5%" }

In [horizontal diagrams](/visualisation/core/directionality), irrespective of writing direction:

* Control information appears above the Arrows/Nodes.
* Ownership information appears below the Arrows/Nodes.

You can remember this with the mnemonic: "*control oversees, ownership underlies*".
