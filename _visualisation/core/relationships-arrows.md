position: 4

Arrows connect Nodes, showing that one Party has a relationship with another. Most often, this is used to show a Direct Interest.

## Direction

The direction of the Arrow is the direction of the relationship as phrased in an active voice.

* For Arrows representing interests, the Party at the start of the Arrow is interested in the Party at the end of the Arrow.
* For Arrows representing other relationships (e.g. father and son), decide which direction you want to emphasise (e.g. "is the father of" vs. "is the son of").

All interest Arrows in a diagram must proceed in the same direction whenever possible, e.g. always down, or always left/right, according to your chosen [Directionality](/visualisation/core/directionality).


## Nature and Strength

There are two types of interest relationship: **ownership** and **control**.

* The **nature** of an interest is whether it is an ownership or control interest.
* The **strength** of an interest is how much interest exists, for instance 10% ownership vs. 90% ownership.

Just one Arrow is used to represent any nature or strength of interest.

* Under the [Core Rules](/visualisation/core), the design of the Arrow provides no indication of the nature or strength of interest.
* Using the [Optional Features](/visualisation/optional) for [Annotation](/visualisation/optional/annotation) and [Colour](/visualisation/optional/colour), you can indicate the specific nature and/or strength of interest that an Arrow represents.

You must add an [Annotation](/visualisation/optional/annotation) to explain non-interest relationship Arrows.


## Appearance

Non-interest relationship Arrows should be drawn less prominently than interest Arrows, for instance using a tint.

For all kinds of Arrows:

* You may draw them straight, curly or with elbow joints – whatever works best.
* Don't omit the arrowhead – this ensures the direction of the relationship is clear.
