The Core Rules must be followed for all BOVS Diagrams.
{: .lead }

They apply whether your diagram represents real or fictional situations, is drawn by hand, generated by a computer, or is professionally designed, and whether it appears digitally or in print.


## Core Rules

### Key terms

![Nodes and Arrows](/visualisation/diagrams/bovs-core-definitions.png){: style="width: 62.5%" }

BOVS diagrams consist of Nodes connected by Arrows.
{: .lead }

[Definitions](/visualisation/core/definitions){: .button }

Nodes represent Parties, the participants in beneficial ownership relationships.
{: .lead }

Key types of Parties include Persons (private individuals) and Entities (legal constructions, like Companies). Each type of Party has an associated icon.

[Vocabulary](/visualisation/core/vocabulary){: .button }

### The basics

![Parties in a BOVS Diagram with icons and labels](/visualisation/diagrams/bovs-core-parties.png){: style="width: 62.5%" }

Parties are drawn as a circle containing an icon, with a label underneath.
{: .lead }

[Parties (Nodes)](/visualisation/core/parties-nodes){: .button }

Arrows connect Parties, representing their relationships or interests, which may be ownership or control interests, or both.
{: .lead }

Interest Arrows flow from the interested Party to the Entity they are interested in. Each type of interest may also have a strength between 0% and 100%.

[Relationships (Arrows)](/visualisation/core/relationships-arrows){: .button }

### Design options

Diagrams flow either vertically downward, or horizontally.
{: .lead }

The direction of flow is from the interested parties toward their objects of interest.

[Directionality](/visualisation/core/directionality){: .button }

Diagrams usually aim to show all the Beneficiaries of a given Entity.
{: .lead }

However, you may adopt a different focus.

[Focus](/visualisation/core/focus-depth){: .button }

### Keeping diagrams simple

![BOVS Diagram with non-relevant parts diminished](/visualisation/diagrams/bovs-core-relevance.png){: style="width: 100%" }

You must show all Parties involved, but may treat only some as relevant.
{: .lead }

There are ways to diminish the non-relevant parts of your diagram, to emphasise a point you are making.

[Relevance](/visualisation/core/relevance){: .button }

![3 parties in a BOVS Diagram condensed into a Stack](/visualisation/diagrams/bovs-core-stacks.png){: style="width: 100%" }

Multiple Parties can be condensed into a single Node, called a Stack, for clarity.
{: .lead }

[Stacks](/visualisation/core/stacks){: .button }

### How to handle unknowns

![Unknown Party shown with an icon containing a question mark](/visualisation/diagrams/bovs-core-unknowns.png){: style="width: 62.5%" }

Diagrams visualise both the information we know and the information we're missing.
{: .lead }

[Unknowns](/visualisation/core/unknowns){: .button }

### Further rules

Ownership and control information must consistently appear on the correct side.
{: .lead }

This is called the Chirality rule, and applies chiefly if you are using the Optional Feature for [Annotation](/visualisation/optional/annotation).

[Chirality](/visualisation/core/chirality){: .button }

You can summarise the interests of multiple Parties as a single figure.
{: .lead }

For instance, if two Parties each own 50% of a Company, then together they own 100% of it. Arithmetic rules are provided for more complex cases.

[Summarisation](/visualisation/core/summarisation){: .button }


## Optional Features

Once you understand the Core Rules, learn how diagrams can be enhanced further with [Optional Features](/visualisation/optional).

![BOVS Diagram with Annotations](/visualisation/diagrams/bovs-optional-annotation.png){: style="width: 62.5%" }

In particular, [Annotation](/visualisation/optional/annotation) allows you to draw Indirect Arrows to summarise interests, and to add labels to Arrows to indicate their nature or strength.
